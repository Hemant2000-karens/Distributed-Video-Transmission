# Distributed Video Transmission System

This repository contains the source code for a distributed video transmission system built with Django, designed to facilitate real-time video broadcasting and playback across distributed networks. The system incorporates advanced features such as clock synchronization, mutual exclusion, fault tolerance, and distributed transaction management. Utilizing Django's robust framework, the project aims to provide a seamless and scalable solution for video conferencing and streaming applications.

## Key Features

- **Clock Synchronization**: Ensure accurate timing across distributed nodes.
- **Mutual Exclusion**: Control access to shared resources.
- **Election Algorithm**: Automatic failover and fault tolerance.
- **Transparency**: Transparent server selection for seamless client experience.
- **Distributed Transaction**: Logging and timestamping for auditing and analysis.

## Technologies Used

- **Django**: Web framework for backend development.
- **Python**: Programming language for server-side logic.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Frontend development and user interface.
- **Docker**: Containerization for easy deployment and scalability.
- **Redis**: Cache backend for efficient data storage and retrieval.
